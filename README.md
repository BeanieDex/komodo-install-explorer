# Install a Block Explorer for a Komodo Asset Chain

This repository simply modifies @Decker's script from https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo-explorers-install to work for a single Asset Chain

## Instructions

### Setup Assetchain

Either create a new asset chain or launch an existing one using its launch parameters. Then shutdown the daemon using the `stop` command.

Example:

```bash
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ASSETCHAINNAME stop
```

The above step creates the '.conf' file for the assetchain at `$HOME/.komodo/ASSETCHAINNAME/ASSETCHAINNAME.conf` which will be modified and made use of by the explorer installation script.

### Explorer installation

Clone this repository in your home directory and navigate into it

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/gcharang/komodo-install-explorer
cd komodo-install-explorer
```

Run the script: https://github.com/gcharang/komodo-install-explorer/blob/master/setup-explorer-directory.sh
This script installs dependencies and prepares the directory for installing the explorer

```bash
./setup-explorer-directory.sh
```

It should create a subdirectory named `node_modules`

Now run the script: https://github.com/gcharang/komodo-install-explorer/blob/master/install-assetchain-explorer.sh with the assetchain's name as the argument

```bash
./install-assetchain-explorer.sh ASSETCHAINNAME
```

**Note:** Use the `noweb` option like: `./install-assetchain-explorer.sh ASSETCHAINNAME noweb` to stop the script from prompting you to open the port for accessing the explorer through the internet.

This will create a new sub directory named `ASSETCHAINNAME-explorer` and a script named `ASSETCHAINNAME-explorer-start.sh`
It also adds a line to a file called `webaccess` with the assetchain's name and the url to access the explorer from anywhere else.

Start the assetchain with its launch parameters and execute the script `ASSETCHAINNAME-explorer-start.sh` when you want to start the explorer

**Note:** When launching the assetchain for the first time after installing the explorer, add the `-reindex` parameter to its launch parameters.

### Adding another assetchain's explorer and running it at the same time

You can use the `./install-assetchain-explorer.sh ASSETCHAINNAME` command to create explorers for as many asset chains as you want, just by changing the `ASSETCHAINNAME`

You can also run them one at a time or all together at the same time depending on your needs.

The only problem is when the ports of two different assetchains conflict with each other.

In that case, if you wish to run them at the same time, modify the `install-assetchain-explorer.sh` script to have fixed port values that are all distinct and different from the other asstchain's ports. Lets say the assetchain's name is `ASSETCHAINNAME1`, then delete the sub directory named `ASSETCHAINNAME1-explorer` and the script named `ASSETCHAINNAME1-explorer-start.sh` and run the modified `install-assetchain-explorer.sh` with it's name again:

```bash
install-assetchain-explorer.sh ASSETCHAINNAME1
```
